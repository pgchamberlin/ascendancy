Ascendancy
==========

A chess club API
-----------------------

The original idea for this project was to develop a simple API for creating and conducting 
[ladder tournaments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_tournament "Ladder Tournament - Wikipedia"), but in the
meantime the chess club I play at needs a new website backend, so it's getting repurposed.

The idea is that Ascendancy will be an [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer "Representational State Transfer - Wikipedia") service over which all the necessary [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete "Create, read, update and delete - Wikipedia") for
a chess club can be carried out, such as managing teams, games, competitions and players.


Getting started
---------------

**N.B. this project is inchoate, hardly written at all, so don't expect this to do much yet ;-)**

Ascendancy is being written using the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/ "Flask (A Python Microframework)").
Assuming you're on a Linux machine, are familiar with Flask and have pip installed, the best way to get 
started is probably to clone this project, i.e.:

    git clone git@github.com:pgchamberlin/ascendancy.git ascendancy

And then if you don't already have virtualenv installed:

    pip install virtualenv
    
Now create a virtualenv on the clone directory:

    virtualenv ascendancy
    
Activate the virtualenv:

    . ascendancy/bin/activate
    
Navigate to the project's directory:

    cd ascendancy
    
Install Flask from pip:

    bin/pip install Flask

Install nose and mock for testing:

    bin/pip install nose mock

Install MySQLdb:

    bin/pip install MySQL-python
    
You should now be able to fire up the app on localhost:

    bin/python app.py

You should be able to find the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000, if not you might need to [consult the Flask docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation "Flask documentation").

You should also be able to run the tests (which should all pass):

    bin/nosetests
